The STEM model is designed to create and analyse models of soil and track systems.
The tool provides a set of commands for creating the geometry of the model, defining the soil and track properties, setting the boundary conditions and loads, generating the mesh, and performing post-processing on the results.

## Installation

STEM can be downloaded and installed on any system that supports Python.
To install the STEM, follow the following steps:

```python
pip install STEM-Vibrations
```

Further details about the installation can be found [here](https://stemvibrations.readthedocs.io/v1.2.0/installation.html#).

## Usage

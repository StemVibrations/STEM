\section{Introduction}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This benchmark compares the STEM numerical solution against the analytical solution,
for the one dimensional wave propagation in a vertical elastic soil column, subjected to a surface load.

The analytical solution is presented in~\cite{Verruijt_2010}.
The analytical solution provides closed-form expressions for the vertical velocity along the column,
enabling a direct time-history comparison against the numerical model.

\section{Model Description}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% ..............................................................................................
\subsection{Geometry, mesh and loading}
% ..............................................................................................
Two soil domains are modelled, a two-dimensional and a three-dimensional continuum representing vertical columns.
The two-dimensional column is modelled with a height of \qty{10}{\meter} and a width of \qty{0.25}{\meter}.
The three-dimensional column is modelled with a height of \qty{10}{\meter} and a square cross-section of
\qty{0.25}{\meter} by \qty{0.25}{\meter}.
The columns are aligned with the $y$-axis, so that wave propagation is essentially one-dimensional along
the vertical direction.

For the two-dimensional column, the soil is discretised with second-order triangular elements, for the three-dimensional
column, the soil is discretised with second-order tetrahedral elements.
In both cases, an average element size of \qty{0.10}{\meter} is adopted.
An overview of the geometries and meshes adopted for the analysis is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:one_dim_wave_mesh}.
A vertical distributed load is applied on the entire top face of the column. The load acts in compression along
the $y$-direction and is applied as a step function in time:

\begin{equation}
	p(t) =
	\begin{cases}
		0, & t < \qty{0}{\second}, \\
		\qty{-1000}{\kilo\newton\per\meter\squared}, & t \geq \qty{0}{\second}.
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

The four vertical faces are restrained only in the horizontal directions, thereby allowing vertical motion
similar to a one-dimensional situation.
In the two-dimensional case, the side lines are restrained in the horizontal direction.
In the three-dimensional case, the four vertical faces are restrained only in the horizontal directions,
thereby allowing vertical motion similar to a one-dimensional situation.

\subsection{Materials and numerical parameters}
% ..............................................................................................
The soil is modelled as a one-phase continuum with a linear elastic constitutive law, with the
following parameters:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
	\item Young's modulus: \qty{50}{\mega\pascal},
	\item Poisson ratio: \qty{0.3}{},
	\item Solid density: \qty{2000}{\kilogram\per\meter\cubed}.
\end{itemize}

Material damping is included via Rayleigh damping, with parameters that provide a damping ratio of
\qty{0.5}{\percent} at \qty{1}{\hertz} and \qty{80}{\hertz}.

The dynamic analysis is performed over a \qty{0.20}{\second} time window, with a time step of \qty{0.001}{\second}.
The system of equations is solved using the Newmark time integration~\cite{Newmark_1959} scheme with
parameters $\beta = 0.25$ and $\gamma = 0.5$.

\section{Results}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Figure~\ref{fig:one_dim_wave_results} presents the time histories of the
vertical velocity at three points located at: \qty{2.5}{\meter}, \qty{5}{\meter} and \qty{7.5}{\meter}
along the height of the column.
The figure compares the numerical STEM results against the analytical solution of the one-dimensional wave equation.

The arrival times of the incident and reflected waves at the observation point match closely between the numerical
and analytical solutions.
The amplitudes of the displacement and velocity pulses also show very good agreement, with small differences
attributable to the introduced material and numerical damping.

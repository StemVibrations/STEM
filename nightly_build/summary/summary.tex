This report presents the validation and benchmarking of the STEM model through a comprehensive set of numerical
test cases.
The objective of this benchmark study is to verify the numerical accuracy, robustness, and consistency of the
software by comparing its results against analytical solutions and well-established reference
problems from the literature.

The benchmark suite covers a broad range of dynamic and static problems relevant to geotechnical
and structural dynamics. These include single degree-of-freedom oscillators, one-dimensional wave propagation
with and without absorbing boundaries, dynamic and static loading of beams, wave propagation in elastic half-spaces,
strip and point load problems, and the dynamic response of a dam structure.
Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional model formulations are considered where appropriate
to assess consistency and convergence.

The results confirm that STEM provides reliable and accurate numerical solutions for a wide range of soil-structure
interaction and vibration problems. Together with its extensive automated test suite, these benchmarks
demonstrate the suitability of STEM as an open, transparent, and robust modelling tool for the analysis of
railway-induced vibrations and related geotechnical dynamic applications.

# Summary

STEM is an open-source Python software package for the numerical simulation of railway-induced ground vibrations.
It provides a Finite Element framework for modelling the coupled dynamic interaction between trains, railway tracks,
and the subsurface, with particular emphasis on extensibility and reproducibility.
STEM accounts for train dynamics, nonlinear wheel–rail contact, track irregularities, layered soil stratigraphy,
and spatial variability of subsurface properties.
STEM is developed to support the design and assessment of vibration mitigation techniques in railway engineering applications.
STEM is built on top of Kratos Multiphysics [@Dadvand_2010], providing a flexible and extensible framework for
advanced dynamic analyses relevant to environmental vibration assessment.


# Statement of need

Railway-induced vibrations pose significant challenges in densely populated areas.
Vibrations generated by the interaction between trains and tracks propagate through the subsoil and may
adversely affect nearby buildings, infrastructure, and human comfort [@thompson_2009; @Waddington_2014].
Reliable assessment of railway induced vibrations and the effectiveness of mitigation techniques requires numerical
tools that can accurately represent the coupled dynamics of vehicles, track systems, and heterogeneous soil media.

Most existing commercial solutions are closed-source and provide limited flexibility for defining custom
vehicle models, custom train-track interaction models or spatially variable subsurface properties.
STEM addresses this gap by providing an open-source, customisable, research-oriented and practice-friendly package,
specifically designed for railway-induced vibration analysis.
STEM transparent implementation supports reproducible research, facilitates method development,
and enables direct integration into both academic research and engineering consultancy workflows.


# Software description

STEM performs time-domain analyses of railway-induced vibrations using the Finite Element Method (FEM).
The software adopts a modular and layered architecture, in which model definition, meshing, vehicle dynamics,
and stochastic subsurface modelling are clearly separated.
At its core, STEM orchestrates the full simulation workflow, including input generation, solver configuration,
time integration, and post-processing.

The main components of the STEM ecosystem are:


- [STEM](https://github.com/StemVibrations/STEM/): The core package responsible for model setup, input generation,
solver configuration, and post-processing.

- [gmsh utils](https://github.com/StemVibrations/gmsh_utils/): The package for mesh generation using gmsh [@Geuzaine_Remacle_2009],
supporting complex geometries and layered soil profiles.

- [vehicle models](https://github.com/StemVibrations/vehicle_models/): A package containing predefined vehicle models
(2 and 10 degree-of-freedom mass-spring-damper systems).
This package defines a clear interface for user-defined vehicle formulations and custom train–track interaction models.

- [random fields](https://github.com/StemVibrations/RandomFields/): A package for generating stochastic subsurface
parameter fields with user-defined statistical properties and spatial correlation structures.

## Key features

STEM provides the following capabilities:

- 2D and 3D quasi-static and dynamic analysis

  - Multi-layered soil domains with complex geometries

  - Automated meshing, input/output handling, and visualization

- Coupled train–track interaction

  - User-defined vehicle models (UVEC)

  - Nonlinear wheel–rail contact based on Hertzian contact theory [@Timoshenko_1970]

  - Track irregularity [@Zhang_2001] and discontinuity generation [@Kabo_2006]

- Railway track components

  - Explicit modelling of rails, railpads, and sleepers

- Material modelling
  - UMAT interface for user-defined constitutive models

- User experience

  - Comprehensive documentation, tutorials, benchmark cases, and API references

  - Open-source distribution via pip and GitHub


## Mathematical formulation
STEM solves the dynamic equilibrium equation in the time domain using a total Lagrangian formulation with small strains:

$$\mathbf{M}\mathbf{a} + \mathbf{C}\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{K}\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{F_{ext}}\left( t \right)$$

where $\mathbf{M}$, $\mathbf{C}$, and $\mathbf{K}$ are the global mass, damping and stiffness matrices of the entire system, respectively.
$\mathbf{F_{ext}}$ denotes the vector of the external forces, while $\mathbf{a}$, $\mathbf{v}$, $\mathbf{u}$ represent nodal accelerations, velocities, and displacements.

The train is modelled as a multi-degree-of-freedom mass–spring–damper system.

The rail is discretised using Euler–Bernoulli beam elements, the railpads are modelled as spring-damp systems and the
sleepers can either be modelled as concentrated masses or volume elements.
Train–track interaction follows the nonlinear Hertz theory, where the contact force is a nonlinear function
of the relative displacement between the wheel and the rail.
Track irregularities are introduced through stochastic or deterministic profiles, enabling the simulation of
realistic operating conditions such as surface roughness and rail joints.


# Getting STEM

STEM is distributed as an open-source Python package and supports Python versions 3.10–3.12.
The stable release can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI):

```bash
pip install STEM-Vibrations
```

or cloned from the GitHub repository for access to the latest development version.

STEM has a detailed documentation [website](https://stemvibrations.readthedocs.io/),
which includes installation instructions, background on the formulation and theory behind STEM,
STEM definitions, and API references.
The documentation also provides tutorials and example cases to help users get started with the software.
STEM includes automated tests and continuous integration workflows to ensure numerical correctness and long-term maintainability.

STEM also includes a [benchmark report](https://github.com/StemVibrations/STEM/releases/download/pdf-latest/benchmark_report.pdf),
which presents a comprehensive set of benchmark cases comparing STEM results with analytical solutions.
This report serves as a validation resource for users and developers,
demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of STEM in various scenarios relevant to railway-induced vibrations.


# Research impact statement

STEM enables reproducible and extensible research on railway-induced vibrations and the effect of mitigation techniques.

STEM's open-source nature supports method development, benchmarking, and comparison with analytical and experimental results.
The software has been designed to accommodate future extensions, such as advanced constitutive soil models or
alternative vehicle formulations, making it suitable for both academic research and consulting engineering studies.
By integrating detailed train–track interaction with full-field soil response,
STEM provides a unified framework that is often fragmented across multiple tools in existing workflows.

STEM is currently being used in several research and consultancy projects, that focus on the assessment of
vibration mitigation techniques, such as the effect of Meta-barriers, Bio Inspired Soil Improvement [@prorail2025].
